# PRD: Agent Team

A multi-agent orchestration system where a **Product Manager agent** and a **Developer agent** collaborate to ship features autonomously, communicating through Mattermost. Human operator can intervene at any time.

## Implementation Status

All P0–P3 features are implemented. See status markers below.

## User Stories

### P0: Core Workflow (Must Have) — ✅ Complete

**As a** operator,
**I want** the system to automatically suggest, implement, and PR features from the PRD,
**So that** features ship without manual intervention.

- [P0-US1] ✅ PM Agent reads PRD and suggests highest-priority unimplemented feature
- [P0-US2] ✅ Human approves/rejects feature suggestion in Mattermost
- [P0-US3] ✅ Dev Agent runs `/speckit.specify` to create SPEC.md
- [P0-US4] ✅ Dev Agent runs `/speckit.plan` to create plan.md
- [P0-US5] ✅ Dev Agent runs `/speckit.tasks` to create tasks.md
- [P0-US6] ✅ Human reviews plan before implementation (configurable timeout)
- [P0-US7] ✅ Dev Agent runs `/speckit.implement` to implement all tasks
- [P0-US8] ✅ Dev Agent creates PR via `gh pr create`
- [P0-US9] ✅ PM Agent records learnings to `.agent/product-manager.md`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Each workflow produces a PR URL posted to Mattermost
- Human can approve/reject at REVIEW and PLAN_REVIEW checkpoints
- All phases logged to Mattermost with summaries

### P1: Human Intervention (Must Have) — ✅ Complete

**As a** human team member,
**I want** to ask questions and get answers during implementation,
**So that** I can guide the feature direction.

- [P1-US1] ✅ Human can @mention PM Agent with questions during implementation
- [P1-US2] ✅ PM Agent answers based on PRD context
- [P1-US3] ✅ Dev Agent can ask structured questions (JSON format)
- [P1-US4] ✅ Questions posted to Mattermost, PM answers, human can override

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Questions routed correctly (product → PM, implementation → Dev)
- Human override takes precedence over PM answer

### P1: UX Improvements (Should Have) — ✅ Complete

**As a** operator,
**I want** better visual feedback during workflow execution,
**So that** I can quickly understand what's happening.

- [P1-US5] ✅ Phase status shows elapsed time in real-time
- [P1-US6] ✅ Progress emoji added to phase completions (✅ ❌ 🔄)
- [P1-US7] ✅ ANSI color coding for console output (green=info, yellow=warn, red=error)
- [P1-US8] ✅ Config doctor command validates setup (`--doctor`)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Each phase shows "Phase: X | Duration: Ym Zs | Total: Am Bs"
- Phase completions show emoji markers
- Console output uses colors for readability
- Running `--doctor` shows validation results

### P2: Parallel Execution (Should Have) — ✅ Complete

**As a** operator,
**I want** multiple features to implement in parallel,
**So that** throughput increases.

- [P2-US1] ✅ Worker pool spawns N parallel workers (`worker_pool.py`)
- [P2-US2] ✅ Each worker runs independent orchestrator
- [P2-US3] ✅ Redis Streams distributes work to available workers (`src/redis_streams/`)
- [P2-US4] ✅ Parallel task execution within a feature (tasks marked `[P]` run concurrently)
- [P2-US5] ✅ `--simple` flag skips specify/plan/tasks phases for quick fixes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Multiple workers can run simultaneously without conflicts
- Each worker maintains independent state
- tasks.md `[P]` markers trigger concurrent execution
- `--simple` flag bypasses speckit phases

## Architecture: Orchestrator + Worker Handoff

The system uses a distributed architecture where the orchestrator coordinates workflow while workers handle implementation.

### Components

| Component | File | Role |
|-----------|------|------|
| Orchestrator | `orchestrator.py` | Main workflow state machine |
| Responder | `responder.py` | Listens for `/suggest` commands and @mentions in Mattermost |
| Worker | `worker.py` | Redis Streams consumer, runs orchestrator per feature |
| Worker Pool | `worker_pool.py` | Spawns and manages N worker processes |
| Mattermost Bridge | `mattermost_bridge.py` | Dual-bot Mattermost API client |
| Redis State | `state_redis.py` | Redis-backed state persistence |
| Tool Augmentor | `tool_augment.py` | Pre/post phase discovery and validation hooks |
| Augment Analyzer | `analyze_augment.py` | JSONL log analysis for augmentation metrics |
| Redis Streams Lib | `src/redis_streams/` | Consumer, producer, checkpoint, monitoring |

### Orchestrator Responsibilities
1. **PM_SUGGEST**: PM Agent reads PRD, suggests highest-priority unimplemented feature
2. **REVIEW**: Human approves/rejects feature (or auto-approve after timeout)
3. **Publish**: After approval, publish feature to Redis stream (`feature-requests`)
4. **Loop**: Skip dev phases, return to PM_SUGGEST for next feature

### Worker Responsibilities
Workers listen on the Redis stream and pick up approved features:

1. **DEV_SPECIFY**: Run `/speckit.specify` to create SPEC.md
2. **DEV_PLAN**: Run `/speckit.plan` to create plan.md
3. **DEV_TASKS**: Run `/speckit.tasks` to create tasks.md
4. **PLAN_REVIEW**: Human reviews plan (or auto-proceed after timeout)
5. **DEV_IMPLEMENT**: Run `/speckit.implement` for all tasks
6. **CREATE_PR**: Create branch, commit, open PR via `gh pr create`

### Responder
`responder.py` runs as a long-lived process that monitors Mattermost for:
- `/suggest` commands — triggers the orchestrator to suggest and implement the next feature
- `@product-manager` mentions — routes questions to the PM Agent (via Minimax API)

It publishes approved features to the Redis stream for workers to consume.

### Redis Stream Configuration
```yaml
redis_streams:
  url: "redis://localhost:6379"
  stream: "feature-requests"
  consumer_group: "orchestrator-workers"
  defaults:
    max_length: 10000
    block_ms: 5000
```

### Running with Workers
```bash
# Start orchestrator (coordinates, publishes to stream)
uv run python orchestrator.py --loop --project agent-team

# Start responder (listens for /suggest and @mentions)
uv run python responder.py

# Start workers (consume from stream, run implementation)
uv run python worker.py --consumer worker-1
uv run python worker.py --consumer worker-2

# Or start a worker pool (spawns N workers with auto-restart)
uv run python worker_pool.py --workers 3
```

### Message Format
When orchestrator publishes to stream:
```json
{
  "feature": "Feature description",
  "project": "agent-team",
  "rationale": "Why this feature",
  "priority": "P1"
}
```

### Benefits
- Orchestrator is lightweight (just coordinates)
- Workers do heavy lifting (run Claude Code)
- Multiple features can run in parallel
- Each worker has independent state

### P3: Resilience (Could Have) — ✅ Complete

**As a** operator,
**I want** the system to recover from failures,
**So that** interrupted workflows can resume.

- [P3-US1] ✅ State persisted to Redis (`state_redis.py`) or file (`.agent-team-state.json`)
- [P3-US2] ✅ `--resume` flag picks up from last phase
- [P3-US3] ✅ Timeouts handled gracefully with retry logic

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Workflow resumes at correct phase with preserved context

### P3: Observability (Could Have) — ✅ Complete

**As a** operator,
**I want** visibility into workflow progress and metrics,
**So that** I can monitor system health.

- [P3-US4] ✅ Phase durations tracked and displayed in summary
- [P3-US5] ✅ Tool augmentation logs pre/post phase state (`tool_augment.py`)
- [P3-US6] ✅ JSONL logs for post-mortem analysis (`analyze_augment.py`)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Summary shows time per phase
- Logs available for debugging

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Phase timeouts: SPECIFY=60min, PLAN=60min, TASKS=60min, IMPLEMENT=60min
- Worker orchestrator timeout: 2 hours
- Mattermost poll interval: 15s (configurable)
- Worker pool scales to N concurrent workers

### Security
- Bot tokens stored in config.yaml (not in code)
- Local config overrides via `config.local.yaml` (gitignored)
- Mattermost API calls only to configured URL

### Reliability
- Claude session preserved via `--resume`
- Exponential backoff on transient failures (5s, 20s, 80s)
- Worktree cleanup mandatory after PR creation
- Worker pool auto-restarts failed workers

## Test Scenarios

1. **Happy path**: Run orchestrator, approve feature, verify PR created
2. **Rejection**: Run orchestrator, reject at REVIEW, verify no PR
3. **Question**: During impl, ask @product-manager question, verify answer
4. **Resume**: Kill mid-implementation, resume with --resume, verify continuation
5. **Parallel**: Start 3 workers, queue 3 features, verify all complete
6. **Simple mode**: Run with --simple, verify no speckit phases run
7. **Doctor**: Run --doctor, verify validation output
8. **Tool augmentation**: Run with --tools, verify pre/post hooks execute
